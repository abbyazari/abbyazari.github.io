The Azari Research Group (ARG) generally aims to answer fundamental questions in space science and exploration by advancing scientific inference with machine learning. 
We approach this aim by addressing outstanding challenges facing machine learning in science in uncertainty quantification and the inclusion of physical information. 
We ground our work through our domain expertise in planetary space environments. ARG has four primary focus areas as shown below.
