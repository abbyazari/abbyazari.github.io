See below for information on [open opportunities](#open-opportunities) in the group and the [research ecosystem](#machine-intelligence-and-space-research-at-the-u-of-a) at the University of Alberta (U of A). 

## Open Opportunities

Ideal candidates will have experience in data science (e.g. machine learning, statistics, Bayesian methods, inverse problems) and/or plasma science (e.g. fusion, astrophysics, space physics). I often support students who wish to join the group with various experiences (outside of those listed above), and those who have taken a break in their professional journey or are pursuing a change in their careers.

Please see below for the current status regarding [undergraduate](#undergraduate-students), [graduate](#graduate-students), and [post-docs and visitors](#post-doctoral-and-visitor-funding-opportunities) (updated October 25, 2025). 

### Undergraduate Students

I only work with students through payroll, course credit, co-op, or other official opportunities because I view research as valuable labor to a society. I encourage students interested in working with me to pursue paid (e.g. summer, co-op) or credited opportunities (e.g. 399, 499). Undergraduate opportunities are prioritized for students who have completed 300 level coursework. Summer positions are currently closed but coursework and co-op placements are considered on a case by case basis for Winter 2026.

### Graduate Students 
*NOW RECRUITING*

**Fully funded** MSc and PhD positions are open for Fall 2026 entry in [Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html) and [ECE](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html). 

Projects availiable include: (1) merging physics-based models with machine learning for inverse problems, (2) reinforcement learning for scientific observations of events from spacecraft, (3) estimation of planetary habitability at Mars, and (4) solar wind estimation in the solar system. 

**Interested candidates should apply directly to the UA Physics and/or the ECE MSc/PhD programs. Include a statement of research interest _specifically_ mentioning their interest in ARG, the project of interest, and how this aligns with their career goals. The Department(s) determine eligibility. Research group review of applications will occur after the Departmental process. To make sure your application is considered for ARG in the case of Departmental approval; notify aazari@ualberta.ca _after_ submission of your materials.** 

Important Application Information: 

- Applicants who do not yet hold a MSc are strongly recommended to apply to the MSc program first; MSc students are funded as are PhD students.
- Applicants should plan to apply by December 1, 2025 for the widest consideration for Fall 2026 programs. 
- When writing your interest statement review the group's prior [publications](https://abbyazari.github.io/publications/) or current research themes in ARG.
- If your background does not contain _significant_ physics coursework (at least one 400 level physics course such as E&M, Quantum, or Statistical Mechanics) but _does_ posess methodological expertise (e.g. computation, mathematics, probability, statistics), then applicants are suggested to apply to ECE.
- Potential applicants who have specific questions about ARG before or during application should include the following information in their email. A response is not guaranteed. 
  - Your application status
  - Your reason for emailing
  - A CV / resume (which includes GPA in your prior or current educational program) 

### Post Doctoral and Visitor Funding Opportunities 
*NOW RECRUITING*

A post doc position in Mars space environment studies with machine learning is now open for application! Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxEkAPwEXzDOK14e-M7_LcdLrHEtLwOLTXxpYhNyTbU/).

Outside of open calls the following are several (always availiable) avenues to work with the research group. ARG is happy to sponsor visiting scholars and I encourage potential post docs and visitors to review these before contacting me. I am always happy to be pitched a research collaboration of mutual interest by motivated individuals. I am generally interested in machine learning for inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, spatiotemporal datasets, space plasmas, and planetary space environments. I have active projects on solar wind estimation for Mars' space environment and in reinforcement learning for space science.

### Displaced Students and Scholars

  The University participates and sponsors students and scholars whose professional journeys have been disrupted by conflict. Please see this [update from the Provost](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/the-quad/2025/01/from-the-provosts-desk-an-update-on-supporting-displaced-scholars-and-students.html) for more information on programs. 

## Machine Intelligence and Space Research at the U of A

The U of A has a long history of research excellence and global leadership in artificial intelligence. The University ranks second in North America for [AI research](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?ai&northamerica) and is co-located with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Amii is one of three AI-research institutes consisting of more than 35 artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers at the U of A. Particularly, Amii researchers are known for their leadership and development of reinforcement learning including recent recognition of the [Turing Award](https://www.amii.ca/updates-insights/rich-sutton-awarded-a-m-turing-award-for-reinforcement-learning-research).

The U of A has one of the largest and oldest space physics programs in Canada with research in planetary magnetospheres, space weather, magnetohydrodynamics, and fundamental plasma physics. It is a founding member of [Space Environment Canada](https://space-environment.ca/), one of the foremost ground-based array for space physics in the world, and the leading institute behind the [RADICALS](https://radicalsmission.ca/) space mission. The aurora is commonly observed in Alberta, offering unique observational capacity at one of the [top ranked](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/about/university-rankings/index.html) research universities in the world and North America.
