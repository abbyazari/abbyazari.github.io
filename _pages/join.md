See below for information on [open opportunities](#open-opportunities) in the group and the [research ecosystem](#machine-intelligence-and-space-research-at-the-u-of-a) at the University of Alberta (U of A). 

## Open Opportunities

The Azari Research Group (ARG) regularly has openings for interested students. Please see below for the current status (updated March 10, 2025). 

Ideal candidates will have experience in data science (e.g. machine learning, statistics, Bayesian methods) and/or plasma science (e.g. fusion, astrophysics, space physics). I often support students who wish to join the group with various experiences (outside of those listed above), and those who have taken a break in their professional journey or are pursuing a change in their careers.

I only work with students through payroll, course credit, or other official opportunities. While volunteering is valuable I will always encourage students interested in working with me to pursue paid or credited opportunities. Undergraduate opportunities are often prioritized for students who have completed 300 level coursework.   

### Undergraduate Students

  **Summer 2025**
  
  I am recruiting an U of A undergraduate student for a paid summer research opportunity. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EseFZvCz8so8lhnpBwoIOo2hUSiEpkoMgfzbbPfqOPI) for more information and how to apply (U of A login required). Due March 24th.
  
  **Academic Year 25-26**

  I host an academic year long for credit research position for U of A physics undergraduate (incl. engphys, geophys) students through PHYS 399/499. Interested candidates should email aazari+phys99 @ ualberta . ca with the subject line YourLastName_Phys99_App (e.g. Tremblay_Phys99_App, Ng_Phys99_App etc) and:
  - a short (<1 page) description of what you are interested in researching related to ARG and your qualifications
  - your CV or résumé
  - a copy of your unofficial transcripts

Review of applications will begin on August 1st; a response is not guaranteed.

### Graduate Students

  **I am recruiting for a Master's student for Fall 2025 in ~~[Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html)~~ (deadline passed) and [ECE](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html) (still open).**

  Multiple projects are availiable including non-parametric models of the solar wind, merging physics-based models with machine learning estimation, and planetary aurorae studies. Interested candidates should email aazari+msc @ ualberta . ca with the subject line YourLastName_MSc_App (e.g. Devi_MSc_App, Smith_MSc_App etc) and:
  - a short (<1 page) description of why you are interested in the positon and your qualifications
  - your CV or résumé
  - a copy of your unofficial transcripts
  
  Applications are reviewed until the position is filled; a response is not guaranteed. 

### Post Doctoral and Visitor Funding Opportunities

  The following are several (always availiable) avenues to work with the research group. ARG is happy to sponsor visiting scholars and I encourage potential post docs and visitors to review these before contacting me.

  - Banting Fellowship (open to all citizenships), [banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca)
  - NSERC Post Doctoral Fellowshiip (Canadian citizens and permanent residents + additional statuses), [nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp)
  - NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships (US citizens and permanent residents only), certain opportunities can be held at University of Alberta [new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599)
  - More information for post docs is availiable at [ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html)
  - More information for visiting scholars is availiable at [ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/research/research-support/academic-visitor-office/index.html)
 
### Displaced Students and Scholars

  The University participates and sponsors students and scholars whose professional journeys have been disrupted by conflict. Please see this [update from the Provost](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/the-quad/2025/01/from-the-provosts-desk-an-update-on-supporting-displaced-scholars-and-students.html) for more information on programs. 

## Machine Intelligence and Space Research at the U of A

The U of A has a long history of research excellence and global leadership in artificial intelligence. The University ranks second in North America for [AI research](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?ai&northamerica) and is co-located with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Amii is one of three AI-research institutes consisting of more than 35 artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers at the U of A. Particularly, Amii researchers are known for their leadership and development of reinforcement learning including recent recognition of the [Turing Award](https://www.amii.ca/updates-insights/rich-sutton-awarded-a-m-turing-award-for-reinforcement-learning-research).

The U of A has one of the largest space physics programs in Canada with research in planetary magnetospheres, space weather, magnetohydrodynamics, and fundamental plasma physics. It is a founding member of [Space Environment Canada](https://space-environment.ca/), one of the foremost ground-based array for space physics in the world, and the leading institute behind the [RADICALS](https://radicalsmission.ca/) space mission. The aurora is commonly observed in Alberta, offering unique observational capacity at one of the [top ranked](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/about/university-rankings/index.html) research universities in the world and North America.
