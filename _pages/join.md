See below for information on [open opportunities](#open-opportunities) in the group and the [research ecosystem](#machine-intelligence-and-space-research-at-the-u-of-a) at the University of Alberta (U of A). 

## Open Opportunities

Ideal candidates will have experience in data science (e.g. machine learning, statistics, Bayesian methods) and/or plasma science (e.g. fusion, astrophysics, space physics). I often support students who wish to join the group with various experiences (outside of those listed above), and those who have taken a break in their professional journey or are pursuing a change in their careers.

Please see below for the current status regarding [undergraduate](#undergraduate-students), [graduate](#graduate-students), and [post-docs and visitors](#post-doctoral-and-visitor-funding-opportunities) (updated May 5, 2025). 

### Undergraduate Students

I only work with students through payroll, course credit, or other official opportunities. While volunteering is valuable I will always encourage students interested in working with me to pursue paid or credited opportunities. Undergraduate opportunities are prioritized for students who have completed 300 level coursework.

  **Summer**

  Applications closed, check back in for Summer 2026.
  
  **Academic Year**

  I host an academic year long for credit research position for U of A physics undergraduates (incl. engphys, geophys) students through PHYS 399/499 and for engineering undergraduates through the Dean's Research Award. Interested candidates should check their eligibility for these opportunites before emailing aazari+ugrad @ ualberta . ca with the subject line YourLastName_UGrad_App (e.g. Tremblay_UGrad_App, Ng_UGrad_App etc) and:
  - a short (<1 page) description of what you are interested in researching related to ARG and your qualifications
  - your CV or résumé
  - a copy of your unofficial transcripts

 Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis; a response is not guaranteed.

### Graduate Students

Mulitple MSc and PhD positions are open for Fall 2026 in [Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html) and [ECE](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html). 

Projects are availiable including non-parametric models of the solar wind, merging physics-based models with machine learning for inverse problems, reinforcement learning for scientific observations of events from spacecraft, and estimation of planetary habitability. 

Interested candidates should email aazari+grad @ ualberta . ca with the subject line YourLastName_Grad_App (e.g. Devi_Grad_App, Smith_Grad_App etc) and:

  - a short (<1 page) description of why you are interested in the positon and your qualifications
  - your CV or résumé
  - a copy of your unofficial transcripts
  
  Applications are reviewed until the position is filled; a response is not guaranteed. 


### Post Doctoral and Visitor Funding Opportunities

  The following are several (always availiable) avenues to work with the research group. ARG is happy to sponsor visiting scholars and I encourage potential post docs and visitors to review these before contacting me. I am always happy to be pitched a research collaboration by motivated researchers sponsored through external funds.

  - Banting Fellowship (open to all citizenships), [banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca)
  - NSERC Post Doctoral Fellowshiip (Canadian citizens and permanent residents + additional statuses), [nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp)
  - NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships (US citizens and permanent residents only), certain opportunities can be held at University of Alberta [new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599)
  - More information for post docs is availiable at [ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html)
  - More information for visiting scholars is availiable at [ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/postdocs-visitors/funding.html](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/research/research-support/academic-visitor-office/index.html)
 
### Displaced Students and Scholars

  The University participates and sponsors students and scholars whose professional journeys have been disrupted by conflict. Please see this [update from the Provost](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/the-quad/2025/01/from-the-provosts-desk-an-update-on-supporting-displaced-scholars-and-students.html) for more information on programs. 

## Machine Intelligence and Space Research at the U of A

The U of A has a long history of research excellence and global leadership in artificial intelligence. The University ranks second in North America for [AI research](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?ai&northamerica) and is co-located with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Amii is one of three AI-research institutes consisting of more than 35 artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers at the U of A. Particularly, Amii researchers are known for their leadership and development of reinforcement learning including recent recognition of the [Turing Award](https://www.amii.ca/updates-insights/rich-sutton-awarded-a-m-turing-award-for-reinforcement-learning-research).

The U of A has one of the largest and oldest space physics programs in Canada with research in planetary magnetospheres, space weather, magnetohydrodynamics, and fundamental plasma physics. It is a founding member of [Space Environment Canada](https://space-environment.ca/), one of the foremost ground-based array for space physics in the world, and the leading institute behind the [RADICALS](https://radicalsmission.ca/) space mission. The aurora is commonly observed in Alberta, offering unique observational capacity at one of the [top ranked](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/about/university-rankings/index.html) research universities in the world and North America.
