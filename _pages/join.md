See below for information on [open opportunities](#open-opportunities) in the group and the [research ecosystem](#machine-intelligence-and-space-research-at-the-u-of-a) at the University of Alberta (U of A). 

## Open Opportunities

Ideal candidates will have experience in data science (e.g. machine learning, statistics, Bayesian methods, inverse problems) and/or plasma science (e.g. fusion, astrophysics, space physics). I often support students who wish to join the group with various experiences (outside of those listed above), and those who have taken a break in their professional journey or are pursuing a change in their careers.

Please see below for the current status regarding [undergraduate](#undergraduate-students), [graduate](#graduate-students), and [post-docs and visitors](#post-doctoral-and-visitor-funding-opportunities) (updated July 18, 2025). 

### Undergraduate Students

I only work with students through payroll, course credit, or other official opportunities. While volunteering is valuable I will always encourage students interested in working with me to pursue paid (e.g. summer) or credited opportunities (e.g. 399, 499). Undergraduate opportunities are prioritized for students who have completed 300 level coursework. Summer positions are currently closed. Coursework placements are considered on a case by case basis. 

### Graduate Students *NOW RECRUITING*

Fully funded MSc and PhD positions are open for Fall 2026 entry in [Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html) and [ECE](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html). 

Projects availiable include: (1) merging physics-based models with machine learning for inverse problems, (2) reinforcement learning for scientific observations of events from spacecraft, (3) estimation of planetary habitability at Mars, and (4) solar wind estimation in the solar system. 

**Interested candidates should apply directly to the UA Physics or the ECE MSc/PhD programs. Include a statement of research interest _specifically_ mentioning their interest in ARG and the project of interest.** 

Tips and Tricks: Applicants who do not yet hold a MSc are strongly recommended to apply to the MSc program first. When writing your interest statement review the group's prior [publications](https://abbyazari.github.io/publications/) or current research themes in ARG. After applying potential students should notify me of their application via email; a response is not guaranteed. 


### Post Doctoral and Visitor Funding Opportunities

  The following are several (always availiable) avenues to work with the research group. ARG is happy to sponsor visiting scholars and I encourage potential post docs and visitors to review these before contacting me. I am always happy to be pitched a research collaboration of mutual interest by motivated individuals. I am generally interested in machine learning for inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, spatiotemporal datasets, space plasmas, and planetary space environments. I have active projects on solar wind estimation for Mars' space environment and in reinforcement learning for space science.

### Displaced Students and Scholars

  The University participates and sponsors students and scholars whose professional journeys have been disrupted by conflict. Please see this [update from the Provost](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/the-quad/2025/01/from-the-provosts-desk-an-update-on-supporting-displaced-scholars-and-students.html) for more information on programs. 

## Machine Intelligence and Space Research at the U of A

The U of A has a long history of research excellence and global leadership in artificial intelligence. The University ranks second in North America for [AI research](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?ai&northamerica) and is co-located with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Amii is one of three AI-research institutes consisting of more than 35 artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers at the U of A. Particularly, Amii researchers are known for their leadership and development of reinforcement learning including recent recognition of the [Turing Award](https://www.amii.ca/updates-insights/rich-sutton-awarded-a-m-turing-award-for-reinforcement-learning-research).

The U of A has one of the largest and oldest space physics programs in Canada with research in planetary magnetospheres, space weather, magnetohydrodynamics, and fundamental plasma physics. It is a founding member of [Space Environment Canada](https://space-environment.ca/), one of the foremost ground-based array for space physics in the world, and the leading institute behind the [RADICALS](https://radicalsmission.ca/) space mission. The aurora is commonly observed in Alberta, offering unique observational capacity at one of the [top ranked](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/about/university-rankings/index.html) research universities in the world and North America.
