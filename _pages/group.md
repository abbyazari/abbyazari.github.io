<!--### Research Group Vision

The Azari Research Group (ARG) aims to embrace and support a community of researchers to enable the following standards. 

#### Seek Truth
- We create and share work that accurately represents our knowledge and our process.
- We create and share work that consists of our best efforts.
- We recognize the contributions of others in the pursuit of knowledge. 
- We work to increase our, and humanities', understanding of the natural environment including space.

#### Embrace Curiosity
- We bring intellectual curiosity to our interactions.
- We ask questions to increase our understanding as lifelong learners. 
- We are excited to collaborate and share knowledge across domains.
 
#### Support Community
- We value the perspectives and knowledge of individuals who have life experiences and identities different from our own.
- We seek to increase our awareness of historic, and present day, exclusion of communities and their contributions from knowledge sharing.
- We strive to ameliorate the impact of historic exclusion of communities, and their knowledge contributions, from our work.


#### Value Humanity and the Natural World
- We appreciate the intangible benefits of human to human, and human to natural world(s) interaction when pursuing automated methods and artificial intelligence.
- We recognize the importance of planned rest when seeking and advancing knowledge. 
- We iterate on these goals regularly and support each other in enabling this vision as an evolving community of knowledge seekers.
