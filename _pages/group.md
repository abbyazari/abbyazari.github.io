# Culture and Expectations

ARG aims to embrace and support a community of researchers to enable the following standards. 

### Seek Truth
- We create and share work that accurately represents our knowledge and our process.
- We create and share work that consists of our best efforts.
- We recognize the contributions of others in the pursuit of knowledge. 
- We work to increase our, and humanity's, understanding of the natural environment including space.

### Embrace Curiosity
- We bring intellectual curiosity to our interactions.
- We ask questions to increase our understanding as lifelong learners. 
- We are excited to collaborate and share knowledge across domains.
 
### Support Community
- We value the perspectives and knowledge of individuals who have life experiences and identities different from our own.
- We seek to increase our awareness of historic, and present day, exclusion of communities and their contributions from knowledge sharing.
- We strive to ameliorate the impact of historic exclusion of communities, and their knowledge contributions, from our work.

### Value Humanity and the Natural World
- We appreciate the intangible benefits of human to human, and human to natural world(s) interaction when pursuing automated methods and artificial intelligence.
- We recognize the importance of planned rest when seeking and advancing knowledge. 
- We iterate on these goals regularly and support each other in enabling this vision as an evolving community of knowledge seekers.

This vision was last updated in 2025 by A. R. Azari with external feedback from S. Soler, C. Culha, and C. B. G. James.
