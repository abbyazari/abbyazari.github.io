See below for information on [joining](#open-opportunities) the research group and for our research group [vision](#research-group-vision).

## Open Opportunities

Below is the current status of open positions but I am always interested in supporting motivated students and postdocs who are able to pursue independent funding.  

Ideal candidates will have experience in data science (e.g. machine learning, statistics, Bayesian methods) and/or plasma science (e.g. fusion, astrophysics, space physics). 

The research group is interdiscplinary and I support students who wish to join the group with various experiences (outside of those listed above), and those who have taken a break in their professional journey. 

- Undergraduate Students

  I am not recruiting for undergraduate students for summer opportunities.

- Graduate Students

  **I am recruiting for Master's and PhD students for Fall 2025 in [Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html) and [ECE](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html). Potential projects include: predicting space weather at Mars, probability distributions of the solar wind, and planetary aurorae.**

  If you are interested in joining the group please email me with: 1) a brief description of your research interests and how you see them fitting into the research group, 2) a brief description of your background (e.g. a CV or Resum√©), and 3) what program(s) you are interested in. 

- Post Doctoral and Visitor Funding Opportunities

  The following are several (always availiable) avenues to work with the research group. I encourage
  potential post docs and visitors to review these before contacting me.

    - Banting Fellowship (open to all citizenships), [banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca)
    - NSERC Post Doctoral Fellowshiip (Canadian citizens and permanent residents + additional statuses), [nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp)
    - NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships (US citizens and permanent residents only), certain opportunities can be held at University of Alberta [new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/postdocs#postdoctoral-research-fellowships-599)

## Research Group Vision

The Azari Research Group (ARG) aims to embrace and support a community of researchers to enable the following standards. 

### Seek Truth
- We create and share work that accurately represents our knowledge and our process.
- We create and share work that consists of our best efforts.
- We recognize the contributions of others in the pursuit of knowledge. 
- We work to increase our, and humanity's, understanding of the natural environment including space.

### Embrace Curiosity
- We bring intellectual curiosity to our interactions.
- We ask questions to increase our understanding as lifelong learners. 
- We are excited to collaborate and share knowledge across domains.
 
### Support Community
- We value the perspectives and knowledge of individuals who have life experiences and identities different from our own.
- We seek to increase our awareness of historic, and present day, exclusion of communities and their contributions from knowledge sharing.
- We strive to ameliorate the impact of historic exclusion of communities, and their knowledge contributions, from our work.

### Value Humanity and the Natural World
- We appreciate the intangible benefits of human to human, and human to natural world(s) interaction when pursuing automated methods and artificial intelligence.
- We recognize the importance of planned rest when seeking and advancing knowledge. 
- We iterate on these goals regularly and support each other in enabling this vision as an evolving community of knowledge seekers.

This vision was last updated in 2025 by A. R. Azari with external feedback from S. Soler and C. Culha.
