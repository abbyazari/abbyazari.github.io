I am an Assistant Professor jointly appointed in the departments of Physics and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta and a CIFAR AI Chair and research Fellow at the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/). 

My group aims to develop the use of machine intelligence for scientific discovery in planetary science and space physics. We focus on addressing outstanding challenges in uncertainty quantification and the inclusion of physical information. These challenges are broadly shared between scientific domains and our focus centers on probabilistic machine learning and inverse problems. See [abbyazari.github.io/group](https://abbyazari.github.io/group/) for my research group.

I am also a Science Team Member of the [NASA MAVEN](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/maven/) mission to Mars where I lead machine learning research as relevant to studying Mars' space enviroement. Previously, I was an UBC Data Science Fellow, and a post-doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley's Space Science Lab. My PhD is from the University of Michigan College of Engineering's Climate and Space department where I was a NSF Graduate Research Fellow and NASA Earth and Space Sciences Fellow. I spent several years before pursuing graduate education at IDA's Science and Technology Institute.
