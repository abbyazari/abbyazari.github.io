I am a **planetary scientist and space physicist** at the University of California, Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory ([SSL](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)). I am passionate about applying and developing statistical techniques to enable data-driven discovery. My work intersects space physics and planetary science, with techniques from **statistics**, **data visualization**, and **computer science**. 

Most of my work focuses on understanding current **planetary space environments**, and their previous conditions, by studying newly available large datasets from  planetary missions. My current research is focused on analyzing spacecraft data to understand current and past planetary conditions on **Mars** and is partially funded through a new program in AI Use Cases sponsored by NASA. My recent work, as part of my [PhD thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/155251) supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a NASA Earth and Space Sciences Fellowship focused on developing **interpretable methods** for machine learning in planetary science with applications to plasma transport around **Saturn**. 

I am interested in supporting the use of statistical and large-data methods for science and developing educational resources in these practices. These efforts have included co-creating the Machine Learning for Planetary Space Physics [seminar series](https://ml4psp.github.io/), leading a community generated white [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15129) for **incorporating machine learning in planetary science for the next decade** of missions, and serving on the Planetary Data Ecosystem [Independent Review Board]([https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-establishes-board-to-review-planetary-data-ecosystem/](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/pde-irb)) Subcommittee on Mining and Automation. Additionally, I have co-developed a **geoscience visualization and statistics** [course](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences) for physical science students new to computer programming which received an [award](https://crlte.engin.umich.edu/towner-prize-winners/abigail-azari/) from the University of Michigan for outstanding instruction.
