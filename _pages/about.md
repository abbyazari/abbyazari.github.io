I am a **planetary scientist and space physicist** pursuing probabilistic **machine learning** and inverse methods for scientific insight. I lead a research group in the [Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/physics/index.html) and [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html) departments at the Unversity of Alberta. I also pursue research as a Fellow of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/). I am generally interested in advancing uncertainty quantification and interpretable machine learning for large-scale data, or automated methods, in the Earth and space sciences. 

The majority of my research focuses on understanding current **planetary space environments**, and their previous conditions, by studying newly available large datasets from planetary missions. This includes for **Mars** where I am a member of the Science Team of NASAâ€™s [MAVEN](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/maven/) mission. 

I was previously at the University of British Columbia's Data Science Institute and Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences department as a [Data Science Fellow](https://dsi.ubc.ca/projects/2023/gaussian-processes-advancing-understanding-planetary-magnetism-spacecraft). I additionally spent several years at the University of California Berkeley's Space Sciences Lab ([SSL](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)) supported by the MAVEN mission and leading a NASA grant in interdiscplinary AI applications.

<!-- I am interested in supporting the use of machine learning methods for science and developing educational resources in these practices. These efforts have included co-creating the Machine Learning for Planetary Space Physics [seminar series](https://ml4psp.github.io/), leading a community generated white [paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i128/release/1) for **incorporating machine learning in planetary science for the next decade** of missions, and serving on the Planetary Data Ecosystem [Independent Review Board]([https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-establishes-board-to-review-planetary-data-ecosystem/) Subcommittee on Mining and Automation. Additionally, I have co-developed a **geoscience visualization and statistics** [course](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences) for physical science students new to computer programming which received an [award](https://crlte.engin.umich.edu/towner-prize-winners/abigail-azari/) from the University of Michigan for outstanding instruction. -->

<!-- I was previously at the University of California Berkeley's Space Sciences Lab ([SSL](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)) supported by the MAVEN mission and a new NASA program in interdiscplinary AI applications. My [PhD thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/155251) focused on developing **interpretable methods** for machine learning in planetary science with applications to plasma transport around **Saturn** and was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a NASA Earth and Space Sciences Fellowship. -->
