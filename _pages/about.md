I am a **planetary scientist and space physicist** at the University of British Columbia's Data Science Institute and Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences department ([DSI](https://dsi.ubc.ca/), [EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/)). I am passionate about enabling machine learning for scientific discovery.  

Most of my work focuses on understanding current **planetary space environments**, and their previous conditions, by studying newly available large datasets from planetary missions. This includes for **Mars** where I am a science team member on NASAâ€™s [MAVEN](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/maven/) mission. 

In January 2025 I will be joining the University of Alberta's Physics and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments as an assistant professor.

<!--I was formerly at the University of California Berkeley's Space Sciences Lab ([SSL](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)) supported by the MAVEN mission and a new NASA program in interdiscplinary AI applications. My [PhD thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/155251) focused on developing **interpretable methods** for machine learning in planetary science with applications to plasma transport around **Saturn** and was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a NASA Earth and Space Sciences Fellowship. 

I am interested in supporting the use of machine learning methods for science and developing educational resources in these practices. These efforts have included co-creating the Machine Learning for Planetary Space Physics [seminar series](https://ml4psp.github.io/), leading a community generated white [paper](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i128/release/1) for **incorporating machine learning in planetary science for the next decade** of missions, and serving on the Planetary Data Ecosystem [Independent Review Board]([https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-establishes-board-to-review-planetary-data-ecosystem/) Subcommittee on Mining and Automation. Additionally, I have co-developed a **geoscience visualization and statistics** [course](https://github.com/abbyazari/data_vis_statistics_geosciences) for physical science students new to computer programming which received an [award](https://crlte.engin.umich.edu/towner-prize-winners/abigail-azari/) from the University of Michigan for outstanding instruction.-->
